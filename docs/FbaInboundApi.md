<a name="confirmTransport"></a>
# **confirmTransport**
> ConfirmTransportResponse confirmTransport(shipmentId)



Confirms that the seller accepts the Amazon-partnered shipping estimate, agrees to allow Amazon to charge their account for the shipping cost, and requests that the Amazon-partnered carrier ship the inbound shipment.  Prior to calling the confirmTransport operation, you should call the getTransportDetails operation to get the Amazon-partnered shipping estimate.  Important: After confirming the transportation request, if the seller decides that they do not want the Amazon-partnered carrier to ship the inbound shipment, you can call the voidTransport operation to cancel the transportation request. Note that for a Small Parcel shipment, the seller has 24 hours after confirming a transportation request to void the transportation request. For a Less Than Truckload/Full Truckload (LTL/FTL) shipment, the seller has one hour after confirming a transportation request to void it. After the grace period has expired the seller&#x27;s account will be charged for the shipping cost.  **Usage Plan:**  | Rate (requests per second) | Burst | | ---- | ---- | | 2 | 30 |  For more information, see \&quot;Usage Plans and Rate Limits\&quot; in the Selling Partner API documentation.

# **createInboundShipmentPlan**
> CreateInboundShipmentPlanResponse createInboundShipmentPlan(body)



Returns one or more inbound shipment plans, which provide the information you need to create one or more inbound shipments for a set of items that you specify. Multiple inbound shipment plans might be required so that items can be optimally placed in Amazon&#x27;s fulfillment network—for example, positioning inventory closer to the customer.
